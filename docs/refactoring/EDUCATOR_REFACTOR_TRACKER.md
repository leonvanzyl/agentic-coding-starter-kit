## üìù Notes & Observations

### Patterns Identified
- Most pages fetch data in useEffect
- No consistent error handling
- Mixed async/await and .then patterns
- Inconsistent state management

### Risks Identified
- Quiz create page is tightly coupled
- No test coverage
- API endpoints not documented
- No error boundaries

### Opportunities
- Can reduce code by 40% with components
- Can improve performance with lazy loading
- Can add proper TypeScript types
- Can implement proper caching
