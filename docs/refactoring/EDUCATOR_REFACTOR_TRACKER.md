## üìà Metrics Tracking

### Theme Consistency
- Blue colors remaining: 81/81 (0% complete)
- Biblical theme applied: 0/16 pages (0% complete)
- Consistent loaders: 2/16 pages (12.5% complete)

### Code Quality
- Average file size: ~150 lines (target: <300)
- Largest file: 1269 lines (quiz/create)
- Components created: 1/25+ planned
- TypeScript coverage: Partial

### Performance
- Bundle size: Baseline recorded
- Load time: Baseline recorded
- Lighthouse score: Baseline recorded

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Immediate (Today)
1. [ ] Run baseline build and save output
2. [ ] Take screenshots of all 16 pages
3. [ ] Create API test suite
4. [ ] Set up safety branch

### Tomorrow
1. [ ] Create PageHeader component
2. [ ] Create LoadingState component
3. [ ] Test on webhook-logs page (safest)

### This Week
1. [ ] Complete all foundation components
2. [ ] Refactor 3 low-risk pages
3. [ ] Document all changes

## üìù Notes & Observations

### Patterns Identified
- Most pages fetch data in useEffect
- No consistent error handling
- Mixed async/await and .then patterns
- Inconsistent state management

### Risks Identified
- Quiz create page is tightly coupled
- No test coverage
- API endpoints not documented
- No error boundaries

### Opportunities
- Can reduce code by 40% with components
- Can improve performance with lazy loading
- Can add proper TypeScript types
- Can implement proper caching
