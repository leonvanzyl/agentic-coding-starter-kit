# Educator Reminder System

## Overview

The Educator Reminder System is an intelligent engagement platform that helps re-engage inactive educators through personalized, contextual email reminders. The system uses sophisticated activity tracking and spam prevention to ensure meaningful communication without overwhelming recipients.

## What is the Educator Reminder System

The Educator Reminder System automatically identifies educators who have become inactive and sends them encouraging, biblically-themed reminders to return to their teaching ministry. It tracks multiple activity signals and uses intelligent algorithms to determine the optimal timing and content for each reminder.
