# Quiz Diagnostics & Telemetry

## Overview

The Quiz Diagnostics & Telemetry system provides lightweight monitoring of quiz-taking sessions to identify and diagnose issues that cause quiz failures. It captures critical checkpoints and error patterns without impacting performance or user privacy.

## What is Quiz Diagnostics & Telemetry

This system tracks essential metrics during quiz sessions to understand why students might fail to complete quizzes. It operates with minimal performance impact (less than 0.1%) and only transmits data when errors or failures occur, ensuring efficient resource usage.

### Core Workflow

1. System initializes diagnostics when quiz loads
2. Tracks critical checkpoints as student progresses
3. Monitors for errors and abnormal patterns
4. Sends diagnostic data only if issues detected
5. Provides administrators with failure analysis

### Key Components

- **Checkpoint Tracking**: Monitors key quiz progression points
- **Error Detection**: Captures JavaScript and network errors
- **Device Intelligence**: Identifies browser and device characteristics
- **Lightweight Collection**: Minimal data with negligible performance impact
- **Smart Transmission**: Only sends data when needed

## Business Value

### Problem Statement

Quiz platforms often face mysterious failures where students cannot complete assessments. Common issues include:
- Browser compatibility problems
- Network connectivity issues
- Device-specific bugs
- Session timeout problems
- User interface glitches

Without diagnostics, these issues remain invisible, leading to frustrated students and lost assessment data.

### Solution Benefits

- **Issue Visibility**: Understand why quizzes fail
- **Proactive Resolution**: Identify patterns before they become widespread
- **Student Support**: Provide specific help based on failure type
- **Platform Improvement**: Data-driven bug fixes and optimizations
- **Reduced Support Burden**: Fewer "quiz didn't work" tickets

## User Types and Personas

### Primary Users

**Platform Administrators**
- Need visibility into technical issues
- Require actionable data for troubleshooting
- Must prioritize fixes based on impact
- Want to reduce support tickets

### Secondary Users

**Students**
- Experience fewer quiz failures
- Receive better support when issues occur
- Benefit from improved platform stability

**Educators**
- See reduced quiz abandonment rates
- Get clearer reports on technical vs. academic failures
- Can better support struggling students

## User Workflows

### Primary Workflow

**Automatic Diagnostic Collection**
1. Student starts quiz session
2. Diagnostics initialize silently
3. System tracks progression checkpoints
4. If error or timeout occurs, captures context
5. Sends minimal diagnostic payload
6. Admin reviews aggregated failure data
7. Platform improvements implemented

### Alternative Workflows

**Pattern Detection Workflow**
1. Multiple students experience similar issue
2. System aggregates diagnostic data
3. Pattern emerges (e.g., Safari on iOS failing)
4. Alert generated for administrators
5. Targeted fix developed and deployed

**Support Ticket Resolution**
1. Student reports quiz failure
2. Support checks diagnostic data
3. Specific issue identified (e.g., network timeout)
4. Targeted assistance provided
5. Root cause addressed if systemic

## Functional Requirements

- Initialize diagnostics without user interaction
- Track essential checkpoints (page load, quiz load, question visibility)
- Detect browser type and version
- Identify device category (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Capture screen dimensions
- Count errors without storing details
- Monitor tab switching behavior
- Send data only on failure events
- Store diagnostics with minimal database impact

### Supporting Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live dashboard of current issues
- **Historical Analysis**: Trend identification over time
- **Filtering Capabilities**: View by browser, device, or error type
- **Export Functions**: Generate reports for technical team
- **Alert System**: Notify when failure rates spike
- **Privacy Protection**: No personal data collection

## User Interface Specifications

**Admin Diagnostics Dashboard**
- Failure rate visualization (graph)
- Browser/device breakdown (pie charts)
- Recent failures list with details
- Checkpoint success rates
- Error type distribution
- Time-based trend analysis

**Diagnostic Detail View**
- Session information (timestamp, duration)
- Device specifications
- Checkpoint progression
- Error counts by type
- Network performance indicators
- Suggested resolutions

**Alert Configuration**
- Failure rate thresholds
- Notification preferences

## Security Considerations

- No collection of personal information
- No storage of quiz answers or content
- Minimal data retention period
- Secure transmission of diagnostic data
- Access restricted to administrators
- Compliance with privacy regulations

## Testing Strategy

**Functional Testing**
- Verify checkpoint tracking accuracy
- Test error detection mechanisms
- Validate data transmission triggers
- Confirm privacy compliance

**Performance Testing**
- Measure impact on quiz loading time
- Test with slow network conditions
- Verify minimal CPU/memory usage
- Validate battery impact on mobile

**Failure Simulation**
- Test with network interruptions
- Simulate browser crashes
- Create JavaScript errors
- Test session timeouts

## Success Metrics

- **Performance Impact**: Less than 0.1% overhead
- **Issue Detection Rate**: Capture 95% of technical failures
- **Data Efficiency**: Less than 2KB per diagnostic report
- **Resolution Time**: 50% reduction in troubleshooting duration
- **Support Tickets**: 30% decrease in technical issue reports
- **Platform Stability**: 25% reduction in quiz abandonment rate
