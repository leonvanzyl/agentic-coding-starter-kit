# Permission Templates

## Overview

Permission Templates provide a flexible, scalable system for managing educator access rights and resource limits. Administrators can create, apply, and manage permission sets that control what educators can do within the platform.

## What are Permission Templates

Permission Templates are pre-configured sets of permissions and resource limits that can be applied to educators. Instead of manually configuring permissions for each educator, administrators can select from predefined templates during the approval process.

### Core Workflow

1. Administrator creates or selects permission templates
2. During educator approval, admin selects appropriate template
3. Template permissions are automatically applied to educator account
4. Educators operate within their assigned permission boundaries

### Key Components

- **Permission Sets**: Define what actions educators can perform (publish, edit, delete, etc.)
- **Resource Limits**: Control maximum students, quizzes, and questions
- **Template Library**: Pre-built templates for common educator types
- **Bulk Management**: Apply templates to multiple educators simultaneously

## Business Value

### Problem Statement

Managing individual educator permissions manually is time-consuming and error-prone. As the platform scales, administrators need an efficient way to:
- Standardize permission levels across educator groups
- Quickly onboard new educators with appropriate access
- Manage resource allocation to prevent system abuse
- Offer tiered service levels (basic, premium, unlimited)

### Solution Benefits

- **Efficiency**: One-click permission assignment during approval
- **Consistency**: Standardized permission levels across similar users
- **Scalability**: Easy management of hundreds of educators
- **Flexibility**: Create custom templates for special cases
- **Control**: Granular resource limits prevent system overload

## User Types and Personas

### Primary Users

**System Administrators**
- Need to manage educator access efficiently
- Require visibility into permission assignments
- Must balance resource allocation across platform

### Secondary Users

**Educators**
- Experience different feature access based on assigned template
- Work within resource limits appropriate to their tier
- May request upgrades to higher permission levels

## User Workflows

### Primary Workflow

**Educator Approval with Template Assignment**
1. Admin reviews pending educator application
2. Opens approval dialog
3. Reviews available permission templates
4. Selects appropriate template based on educator's needs
5. Confirms approval with selected template
6. System applies template permissions to educator account

### Alternative Workflows

**Bulk Template Update**
1. Admin identifies group of educators needing permission change
2. Selects multiple educators from management interface
3. Chooses new template to apply
4. Confirms bulk update
5. System updates all selected educators

**Custom Template Creation**
1. Admin identifies need for new permission configuration
2. Creates new template with specific permissions
3. Sets resource limits and features
4. Saves template for future use
5. Template becomes available in approval workflow

## Functional Requirements

- Display available templates during educator approval
- Show template details (permissions and limits) for review
- Apply template permissions atomically during approval
- Support bulk template updates for multiple educators
- Allow custom template creation and management
- Provide fallback to default permissions if no template assigned
- Track template assignments in educator profiles

### Supporting Features

- **Template Preview**: View permissions before applying
- **Template Comparison**: Compare different templates side-by-side
- **Activity Logging**: Track all template operations
- **Template Status**: Active/inactive template management
- **Default Template**: Automatic assignment for standard approvals

## User Interface Specifications

**Approval Dialog**
- Dropdown selector with template names
- Template description and key limits displayed
- Visual indicators for permission levels
- Confirmation button with selected template name

**Template Management Page**
- List view of all templates with key attributes
- Create/Edit/Delete controls for administrators
- Toggle switches for individual permissions
- Number inputs for resource limits
- Save/Cancel actions with validation

**Educator Profile View**
- Display current template assignment
- Show effective permissions from template
- Option to change template (admin only)
- Visual badge indicating template tier

## Security Considerations

- Template management restricted to administrator role
- Activity logging for all template operations
- Validation of template existence before application
- Graceful fallback if template system unavailable
- Prevention of privilege escalation through template manipulation

## Testing Strategy

**Functional Testing**
- Verify template application during approval
- Test bulk update functionality
- Validate permission enforcement
- Check resource limit compliance

**Edge Cases**
- Handle missing templates gracefully
- Test with maximum resource limits
- Verify behavior when template deleted
- Test permission inheritance and overrides

**User Acceptance Testing**
- Admin workflow for template selection
- Educator experience with different templates
- Performance with large numbers of templates
- Mobile interface compatibility

## Success Metrics

- **Adoption Rate**: Percentage of educators with assigned templates
- **Time Savings**: Reduction in approval process duration
- **Error Reduction**: Decrease in permission-related support tickets
- **Template Usage**: Distribution of educators across template types
- **System Performance**: Resource consumption within defined limits
- **User Satisfaction**: Admin feedback on management efficiency
