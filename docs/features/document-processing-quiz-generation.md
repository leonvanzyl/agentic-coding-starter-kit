# Document Processing & Quiz Generation

## Overview

The Document Processing & Quiz Generation feature enables educators to automatically create quizzes from uploaded educational materials. Using advanced AI processing, the system transforms documents into structured, pedagogically-sound quiz questions with biblical context.

## What is Document Processing & Quiz Generation

This feature allows educators to upload documents (PDFs, text files, Word documents) and automatically generate quiz questions based on the content. The system uses LightRAG for document indexing and AI models for intelligent question generation.

### Core Workflow

1. Educator uploads educational document
2. System processes and indexes document content
3. AI generates contextually-relevant quiz questions
4. Educator reviews and customizes generated questions
5. Quiz is published for student enrollment

### Key Components

- **Document Upload Interface**: Drag-and-drop file upload with progress tracking
- **Processing Pipeline**: Document parsing, indexing, and knowledge graph creation
- **Question Generation**: AI-powered creation of multiple-choice questions
- **Review System**: Educator tools for question refinement and replacement
- **Publishing Tools**: Quiz configuration and distribution options

## Business Value

### Problem Statement

Creating high-quality educational quizzes is time-consuming and requires significant effort. Educators spend hours:
- Reading through materials to identify key concepts
