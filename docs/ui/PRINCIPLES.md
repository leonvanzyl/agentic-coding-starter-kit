## Decision Framework

When making design decisions, ask:

1. **Is it friendly?** Would this encourage a nervous student?
2. **Is it thumb-friendly?** Can mobile users easily interact?
3. **Is it focused?** Is the primary action obvious?
4. **Is it fresh?** Does it feel modern and engaging?
5. **Is it consistent?** Does it match existing patterns?
6. **Is it fast?** Does it respond immediately?
7. **Is it accessible?** Can everyone use it?
